                While Junji Ito has been aware of these projects, he is not officially apart of them and they are
                different from his original work. He thoroughly enjoys everyone who takes inspiration from his work and
                turns it into new art, and often a Junji Ito easter egg is involved in these inspired works. </p>

                    <p>
                        Grotesque Beauty is a horror narrative game featuring branching paths and 30 gruesome endings.
                        The game focuses on building an eerie atmosphere and haunting visuals rather than relying on
                        jump scares. This visual novel is inspired by the work of Junji Ito and Nakayama Masaaki.

                        was created by Polish developer Paweł Koźmiński and published by Ysbryd Games. Developer
                        panstasz added a cameo of Ito-san as "Mr. OOO, the Struggling Artist" and other various Junji

                    <p>
                        Nanno is a mysterious and clever girl who should be avoided when she's in the area. She
                        transfers to different schools, and when she lands at a new institution, she exposes the lies
                        and misdeeds of the students and faculty at every turn. The girls Nanno encounters often want to
                        try to destroy her, but she always has the upper hand. When a student with a girlfriend gets
                        mistakenly linked to Nanno, he becomes a social media sensation. After the truth about Nanno's
                        high school life is revealed, she makes sure there are no happy endings. The lead actress has
                        openly said she's a big junji ito fan and used Tomie as the direct source reference for the
                        part.
