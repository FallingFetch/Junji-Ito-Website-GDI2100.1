                                Junji Ito began to draw manga at the age of 4, taking inspiration from the works he read
                                in magazines. He continued to draw as a hobby until he became a dental technician in
                                1984, where he struggled to find a balance between the two. In 1987, he submitted a
                                short story to Monthly Halloween that won an honourable mention in the Kazuo Umezu Prize
                                (with Umezu himself as one of the judges). This story ran for 13 years and was later
                                serialized as Tomie.

                        <p>
                            Junji Ito was born on July 31, 1963, in Sakashita, now a part of Nakatsugawa, Gifu. He began
                            his experience in the horror world at a very young age, with his first manga being Mummy
                            Teacher by Kazuo Umezu; his two older sisters read Umezu and Shinichi Koga in magazines, and
                            consequently, he began reading them too. He grew up in the countryside, in a small city next
                            to Nagano. In the house where he lived, the bathroom was at the end of an underground
                            tunnel, where there were spider crickets; such experiences were later reflected in his
                            works.
