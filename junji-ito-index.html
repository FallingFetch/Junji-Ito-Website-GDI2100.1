            <!-- so, the curved header, firstly i had to create an SVG path and I used a website called https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/ and this was hard in itself having to manually change each number to effect the quadratic bezier curve until i was happy with it.
                after this, it didnt work, because all the numbers were above 1, so it didnt know what to do, so i took the largest X and Y numbers (X=53, Y=17) and divided very number by that to essentially get a percentage. I am ready to write the code.
                I knew i could mask an svg as well as how to mask it thanks to W3schools https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_clipping_masking.asp#:~:text=SVG%20elements%20can%20be%20clipped,mask%20to%20an%20SVG%20element. except i used path instead of the exmaples on that page, as this page told me that's how you add a bezier curve https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_path.asp
