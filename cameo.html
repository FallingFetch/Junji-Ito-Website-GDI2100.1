                Junji Ito has some cameos in other well-known media. These Easter eggs are always fun to come across,
                however, you can find some of the cameos he has made below

                    <h2>Junji Ito in Death Stranding</h2>
                    <p>
                        After a lengthy corporate conflict with Konami and cancellation of Silent Hills, Kojima
                        Productions closed in July 2015 and reformed as an independent video game developer and studio
                        in December. The same month, Hideo Kojima announced his partnership with Sony Interactive
                        Entertainment to make a new PlayStation game, Death Stranding was released by Sony Interactive
                        Entertainment for the PlayStation 4 in November 2019. While the game has heavy influence from
                        Silent Hills, starring Norman Reedus and featuring the likeness of Guillermo del Toro, Junji Ito
                        had no involvement in the game. However, Junji Ito's likeness appears as a cameo early in the
                        game as the Engineer.
